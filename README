Requirements:
Please create a new RN project with the following high-level functionality.

• Use a real API to search for movies as we type – via omdb api below
• Create a "Netflix style" horizontal scroll effect
• Add movies to and remove them from our favourites
• Save user favourites to local storage for the data to appear when the app refreshes.

Notes about implmentation:
The application displayes 2 lists of movies: first one with the searched movies, which are fetched using axion, and the second with the favorite ones, that is stored locally.
The lists of movies are rendered horizontally.
By tapping a movie from the list we can add/remove them from favorites.
All the favorite movies are stored in the local memory using async-storage.

This project uses the yarn package manager. To run the project please follow these steps:

1. yarn install
2. yarn android
